This script is really annoying. There's no need to ask#	you before doing the copy, and it prints too much out to#	the screen. Try to make the script more friendly to use#	by removing features.#	2. See how short you can make the script. I could make#	this one line long.#	3. Notice at the end of the What you Should See I used#	something called cat? It's an old command that "con*cat*enates"#	files together, but mostly it's just an easy way to print#	a file to the screen. Type man cat to read about it.#	4. Find out why you had to write out_file.close() in the code.#	5. Go read up on Python's import statement, and start#	python to try it out. Try importing some thing and see if#	you can get it right. It's alright if you do not.
