# Exercise 34: Accessing Elements of Lists

# Access first element of a list
animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
bear = animals[0]

animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']
# 1. The animal at 1 : 	Python
# 2. The third (3rd) animal : Peacock
# 3. The first (1st) animal : Bear
# 4. The animal at 3 : Kangaroo
# 5. The fifth (5th) animal : Whale
# 6. The animal at 2 : Peacock
# 7. The sixth (6th) animal : Platypus
# 8. The animal at 4. Whale


# Study Drills:
#	1. With what you know of the difference between these types
#	of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1,
#	2010", really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)
#	2. Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can
#	translate them.
#	3. Use Python to check your answers.

# Drill 1
#	Because they are ordinal numbers.
